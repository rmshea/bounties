# Contributing via Bounties

The Solana project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Bounty based contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.solana.com.

When you submit a pull request to this repo, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

After you sign the CLA, and we accept your contribution under our Bounty outlines, our team will
contact you for more information regarding payment.

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Solana team securely at [secure@solana.com](mailto:secure@solana.com). You should
receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via
email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the
[Mission Critical PGP](insert pgp key here)key, can be found in

# Overview
This repo is where we publish, track and document the bounty system for Solana. 

Currently, all bounties will be made `active`, funded, and will be evaluated by [Solana](https://solana.com/). The payouts will be made in [SOL](https://solana.com/) unless noted otherwise. 

Solana is also making weekly payouts for participation for [Tour de Sol](http://solana.com/tds).  

**Keep in mind that our bounty system is a WIP, and it should be expected that changes to the process will be made as the project grows.**

# Announcing Active Bounties

When a bounty proposal has been approved, or when Solana has identified something suitable for a bounty, it will be added to the [Active Bounties](#active-bounties) table.

How the process looks from the `Active` stage to `Concluded` will depend on the scope of work, **Category**, payout structure, etc.

## Well Defined Bounties

Most bounties will be fairly contained, well defined and will not require much communication back and forth. These will typically fall under one of the following **Categories**:

- `Bug fix`
- `Testing`
- `Documentation`
- `Improvements`

### Legal

The bug bounty program is an experimental rewards program for our community to encourage and reward those who are helping us to improve CryptoKitties. You should know that we can close the program at any time, and rewards are at the sole discretion of the Solana Labs team. All rewards are subject to applicable law and thus applicable taxes. Don't target our physical security measures, or attempt to use social engineering, spam, distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, etc. Lastly, your testing must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not yours.
